    It is indeed the session that has a controlling terminal

    The _Single UNIX Specification_ describes the relationship in terms of the _controlling terminal_ being "associated with a session". As it goes on to specify, a controlling terminal has a 1:1 relationship with a session. There is "at most one controlling terminal" associated with a session, and "a controlling terminal is associated with exactly one session".

Q: does there exist a notion of a "controlling shell" and, if yes, how does it relate to the certainly-existing notion of a "controlling terminal"?
