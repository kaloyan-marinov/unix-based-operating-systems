    [This is a lengthy book. Based on reading Chapter 7 (The X Window System),
    I think the book is quite well-written and easy to read.]

    This Debian Reference (version 2.77) (2021-01-10 06:32:51 UTC) is intended to
    provide a broad overview of the Debian system as a post-installation user's guide.
    It covers many aspects of system administration through shell-command examples for
    non-developers.

    How [does the] login process work in Linux?

    Today we will see one basic concept, which is neglected by many Linux users
    if they are not programmers like system admins.
    [The] question is "What happens [during] a login process in Linux?"

    [While] many people are familiar with the Linux booting process,
    in which the `init` process will [be started by the OS kernel at boot],
    in this post we will see what happens
    after the `init` process completes executing `/etc/rc.local` file
    and until we get a `PS1` prompt (so that we can start executing our desired
    commands).
    
    An overview of login process

        `init` [starts a] `getty` process

        the `getty` process [runs] the `login` command

        the `login` process tries to check user credentials
        
        [
        the `getty` read shell property files

        the `getty` [starts a] user "shell" process
        ]

        the `getty` provides you with a `PS1` prompt

        The former makes the latter seem like a promising reference/guidebook.

        also seems like a promising reference/guidebook.
