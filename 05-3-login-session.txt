    In computer science and networking in particular,
    a _session_ is a temporary and interactive information interchange
    between two or more communicating devices,
    or between a computer and user (see _login session_).
    
    A session is established at a certain point in time,
    and then ‘torn down’ - brought to an end - at some later point.
    
    An established communication session may involve more than one message in each
    direction.
    
    A session is typically _stateful_, meaning that at least one of the communicating
    parties needs to hold current state information and save information about the
    session history in order to be able to communicate,
    as opposed to _stateless_ communication,
    where the communication consists of independent requests with responses.

    In computing, a _login session_ is the period of activity between
    a user logging in and logging out of a (multi-user) system.
