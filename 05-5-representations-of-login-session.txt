    On Unix and Unix-like operating systems,
    a login session takes one of two main forms:

        (a) When a textual user interface is used,
            a login session is represented as a _kernel session_
            â€” a collection of _process groups_ with the logout action managed by a
            _session leader_.
        
        (b) Where an _X display manager_ is employed,
            a login session is considered to be
            the lifetime of a designated user process that the display manager invokes.
