    In Unix and Unix-like operating systems,
    an _operating-system (OS) kernel_ is a program
    that controls all computer operations, i.e. it:
        
        (a) coordinates all executing utilities
        
        (b) ensures that executing utilities
            - do not interfere with each other
            - [do not] consume all system resources
        
        (c) schedules and manages all system processes

    (A by jwm):

        In Unix process management, every process has a parent.
        The one exception to this is the `init` process
        which is started by the OS [kernel] at boot.

    Init is typically assigned process identifier 1.

    several additional init implementations have been created, attempting to address
    design limitations in the traditional versions. These include:
        - launchd
        - systemd
        - and others
