    `$$` is the environment variable for the shell's process ID

    To see your current shell along with
        its process ID,
        the process ID of parents,
        and the process ID of current command,
    use:
    ```
    $ pstree -aps $$
    systemd,1 splash fastboot kaslr
    └─lightdm,1050
        └─lightdm,1294 --session-child 12 19
            └─upstart,1883 --user
                └─gnome-terminal-,10481
                    └─bash,3612
                        └─pstree,15684 -aps 3612
    ```

    [If you have used the Terminal application to open two windows,
    issuing `$ pstree -aps $$` in each shows that
    both shell processes have the same parent process.
    That parent is a `gnome-terminal-` process.
    Issuing `kill 3789` in either shell process closes both windows.]
