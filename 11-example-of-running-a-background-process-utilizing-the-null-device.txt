    [question]

        I tried to run an example java program using the following command line...
        what is the trailing part `< /dev/null &` used for?

        ```
        java \
            -cp \
            /home/weka.jar \
            weka.classifiers.trees.J48 \
            –t train_file  \
            >& log \
            < /dev/null \
            &
        ```

        `< /dev/null` is used to instantly send `EOF` to the program,
        so that it doesn't wait for input

        (`/dev/null`, the null device, is a special file that
            discards all data written to it,
            but reports that the write operation succeeded,
            and provides no data to any process that reads from it, yielding EOF immediately
        )

        `&` is a special type of command separator used to background the preceding process.

    [answer by Gilles 'SO- stop being evil']

        `</dev/null` disconnects the program's input from the terminal.
        Some programs react differently
        depending on what their standard input is connected to.
        With the redirection `</dev/null`, the program
            can tell that its input is not coming from a terminal,
            and will receive an end-of-file indication immediately if it tries to read from its standard input.

        The lone `&` at the end causes the program to be executed in the background.

        Note that the standalone `&` is unrelated to `>&`. `>&` is a redirection operator.

        what the shell does when it sees this command line is:
            - Start a process in the background. In the background process:
                - Connect standard input to `/dev/null` (the null device).
                - Connect both standard output and standard error
                  to the file called `log` (creating the file if it doesn't exist yet,
                  and truncating it if it exists).
                - Look for an executable file called `java` in the `$PATH`.
                - Execute that file with the 5 arguments
                    `-cp`,
                    `/home/weka.jar`,
                    `weka.classifiers.trees.J48`,
                    `–t`,
                    `train_file`.
