    For Windows users, the GUI (Graphical User Interface) is _the primary interface for interaction with the operating system_...

    in Linux,

        there are two major _shell interfaces_ for someone to interact with the operating system:
            1. Login Shell
            2. Non-Login Shell

        _GUI is nothing more than just another program_.

            Normally, when a Linux system boots, it prompts you into a _Non-Login Shell_ and waits for your credentials (username/password) to be given.

            Then, once you‘ve successfully logged into the system, you are in a _Login Shell_.

            Q: Wait what? You say you use Ubuntu or Fedora or OpenSuSE or OpenWhatever and you don’t see a terminal, right?
            A: Well, this is due to the fact that most well-known Linux [distributions] _run startup scripts to enable the GUI session from the very beginning_. [In addition], they tend to _automatically [log] you in_ from startup.

        [If] you are ... running a modern distro that automatically boots you into a GUI..., [launching the Terminal application] once you’ve successfully logged in [creates/gives] what is commonly called [a] Non-Login Shell, because you have already logged in.

        If you
            completely logout from your GUI session (eg kill X server)
            or boot into a non-graphical interface (just _switch session_ using CTRL + ALT + F[1=7] keys)
        you will see ... what we call [a] Login Shell, because you have not logged in yet (but you are going to).
        
        Different scripts may run on Login and Non-Login Shells. We will talk about them later in another article here at Unixmen.com
        (TODO: look for that article)

        Furthermore, in Linux we have up to 7 different sessions. In order to [switch to any one of them], you can use a common shortcut: CTRL + ALT + F-key (from 1 to 7)... In each session you can be a different user also, which means [that, ] when you [switch to another session, the first thing that will happen is that "the OS"(?) will ask for you to provide authentication credentials for a user of your choice]... In order to come back into the normal GUI session, [hit] CTRL + ALT + [F2] (Ubuntu).

        So, since the desktop is NOT the only interface to interact with the system, there are several GUIs [available and you] are free to use [whichever one] you want — if you want and when you want. For example, [A Linux machine running a  "webserver process" (= one that serves a web application) does] not utilize [a GUI] at all because there is no reason for such software.

    To sum up, there are two different kinds of shells in Linux: Login Shell and Non-Login Shell. Normally, Linux boots you into a Login Shell by default; [after] you [have] logged in, you are [in] a Non-Login Shell. Pretty simple and easy explanation.
