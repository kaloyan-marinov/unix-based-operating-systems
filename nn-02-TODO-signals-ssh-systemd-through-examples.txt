without `nohup` - hinting that Unix signals should be my next investigation

	https://serverfault.com/questions/117152/do-background-processes-get-a-sighup-when-logging-off

		introduces `shopt | grep huponexit`


seems to somewhat duplicate (but also build onto) the previous link

	https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/84737/in-which-cases-is-sighup-not-sent-to-a-job-when-you-log-out

		introduces `shopt | grep checkjobs`
		[which, on macOS, doesn't work;
		results in `-bash: shopt: checkjobs: invalid shell option name`]

		talks about SSH, in a cursory but good-enough-for-now manner

		[delete] links to the brief but informative https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2009-03/msg00091.html

[delete] https://serverfault.com/questions/115968/ssh-session-drops-does-the-command-continue-executing

	[delete] already has answers here:
	https://serverfault.com/questions/463366/does-getting-disconnected-from-an-ssh-session-kill-your-programs

	"actually ispired ... the question" located at the first link within this file

	[delete]  focuses more heavily on SSH and systemd

	[delete]  culminates with a recommendation that one should use virtual terminal solutions like `tmux` and the older `screen` which create sessions which continue running even if you are disconnected, and to which you can reattach later.
