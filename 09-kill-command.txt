    The command `kill` sends the specified signal
    to the specified process or process group.

    If no signal is specified, the `TERM` signal is sent.
    The `TERM` signal will kill processes which do not catch this signal.

    For other processes, it may be necessary to use the `KILL` (`9`) signal,
    since this signal cannot be caught.

    Even though a frozen or unresponsive process may not respond to a ... `TERM` signal,
    it will die when sent a `KILL` signal

    Generally,
    you should use `kill` (short for `kill -s TERM`, or on most systems `kill -15`)
    before `kill -9` (`kill -s KILL`)
    to give the target process a chance to clean up after itself.
    
    (Processes can't catch or ignore `SIGKILL`,
    but they can and often do catch `SIGTERM`.)

    If you don't give the process a chance to finish what it's doing and clean up,
    it may leave corrupted files (or other state) around
    that it won't be able to understand once restarted.
